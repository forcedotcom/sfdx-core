## Branches

- We work in branches off of `main`.
- Our released (aka. _production_) branch is `main`.
- Our work happens in _topic_ branches (feature and/or bug-fix).
  - feature as well as bug-fix branches are based on `main`
  - branches _should_ be kept up-to-date using `rebase`
  - [commit messages are enforced](DEVELOPING.md#When-you-are-ready-to-commit)
  - see below for further merge instructions

### Merging between branches

- We try to limit merge commits as much as possible.

  - They are usually only ok when done by our release automation.

- _Topic_ branches are:

  1. based on `main` and will be
  1. squash-merged into `main`.

### Releasing
- A new version of this library will be published upon merging PRs to `main`, with the version number increment based on commitizen.

- Develop features and bug fixes in _topic_ branches.
- _Topic_ branches can live in forks (external contributors) or within this repository (committers).
