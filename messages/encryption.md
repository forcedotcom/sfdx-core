# v1CryptoWithV2KeyWarning

The SF_CRYPTO_V2 environment variable was set to "false" but a v2 crypto key was detected. v1 crypto can only be used with a v1 key. Unset the SF_CRYPTO_V2 environment variable.

# v2CryptoWithV1KeyWarning

SF_CRYPTO_V2 was set to "true" but a v1 crypto key was detected. v2 crypto can only be used with a v2 key. To generate a v2 key:

1. Logout of all orgs: `sf org logout --all`
2. Delete the sfdx keychain entry (account: local, service: sfdx). If `SF_USE_GENERIC_UNIX_KEYCHAIN=true` env var is set, you can delete the `key.json` file.
3. Set `SF_CRYPTO_V2=true` env var.
4. Re-Authenticate with your orgs using the CLI org login commands.
