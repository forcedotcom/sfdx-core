# SourceStatusResetFailureError

Successfully created org with ID: %s and name: %s. Unfortunately, source tracking isnâ€™t working as expected. If you run force:source:status, the results may be incorrect. Try again by creating another scratch org.

Make sure that the org with username %s and ID %s is enabled as a Dev Hub. To enable it, open the org in your browser, navigate to the Dev Hub page in Setup, and click Enable.
If you still see this error after enabling the Dev Hub feature, then re-authenticate to the org.
