NOTICE: GitHub is not a mechanism for receiving support under any agreement or SLA. If you require immediate assistance, please use official support channels.

This repository only supports the Salesforce CLI Core libraries if you have identified a bug that is not related to the Core Libraries but instead to the Salesforce CLI or the force commands please submit your issue to the forcedotcom/cli repo not this one. 

If you have a question or are stuck and need help moving forward with the Salesforce CLI please go to the SalesforceDX Trailblazer community https://success.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F93A000000HTp1 to post a question or submit a case with Salesforce support
