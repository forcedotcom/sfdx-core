every change should pass

- yarn compile
- yarn lint
- yarn test:only
- yarn bundle:check
- yarn test:nuts

Then run `npx knip` and make sure that modified code do not introduce unused exports or types

- if knip fails due to `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` you can `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx` and re-run it. You'll have to agree to it (or pass `-y` to it)
